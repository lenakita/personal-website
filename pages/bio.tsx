          <p>
            Hello again, and welcome to the bio page of my website. I hope that sharing a little about myself 
            can help in understanding my work and how I write. I love diversity of people in media, be that books, 
            films or video games because it&apos;s a reflection of real life. A lot of my characters, unintentionally mind 
            you, are inspired by people both real and fictional and I hope that if anyone reads my stories that they 
            come to love my characters as much as I do.
          </p>

              I started writing stories at around fifteen years old. Then, I stopped for around six years. 
              What got me back into writing was being a Dungeon Master for a Dungeons & Dragons campaign. 
              I made the mistake of <Link

              >homebrewing</Link> everything,
              from the setting to some of the abilities. I have vowed to keep it simpler next time...

              I passed ABRSM Grade Eight piano aged sixteen. Since then I have not taken another music exam because
              of the limitation of having to learn three pieces to perfection. I much prefer learning a variety of
              songs and I have found that helped with my sight reading of music as well. Classical and video game scores#
              are my favourite types of music. Especially games like Xenoblade. Seriously,
              the soundtrack is <Link

              I enjoy hiking in my spare time. If you are interested the <Link

              Lake District National Park in the United Kingdom, so I am incredibly
              fortunate to have some amazing countryside on my doorstep.

              I studied for a chemistry degree for two months at the University of Liverpool before deciding to
              change courses since I felt that something creative like Computer Science would be a better fit for me.
              In the long run it was for the best, because the creativity I can exercise with software
              is really awesome.

              I also love cats! üê± There are some pictures below of my parent&apos;s cat, Lennie. A fact about him
              is that he grew up on the streets of Sheffield before he was rescued. He has lived with us for the
              ten years since.
