    A long time ago, in a city called Arcuras...

There was a flicker in the weave of song that knitted Aethia together. Something had slipped through the net. A child born in the city of Arcuras, unbeknownst to its developing mind, retained all its memories of the past cycle. Secrets of the world nestled in its tiny brain. From their distant perch Ionad watched with eyes keen as a wyvern&apos;s claws.{multiBreak(2)}
Ionad was the auditor of death. Someone who, when souls went astray and memories snuck through the cracks, cleaned up the mess. Unseen, unheard and completely uncompromising. They were the backbone of the wyverns who scoured Aethia. Their sword and their shield. If claws could hold either, that is.{multiBreak(2)}
Bare feet curled against the frigid metal of the airship floor. With a snap of claws sharp enough to dice the air they told their vessel to set a course. Arcuras, &apos;City of Secrets&apos;. A fitting name, given Ionad recalled every snapshot of the city&apos;s history. Its people, its customs and how it had been forged by enterprising, money grubbing, humans over two hundred turns ago. To Ionad&apos;s alien mind concepts such as culture and wealth were frills on the clothing of life. They lived plainly, simply and with singularity of purpose. It kept things stress-free. Even when there were those who tried to inject disorder into the cycle.{multiBreak(2)}
A flicker of emotion lit their scaled face. Muzzle twisting their lips contorted into what a human might consider a smile. Yet, smiling was as foreign as the Artia tree to Ionad. All they felt was a sense of duty to the balance of the world. A duty they would uphold no matter the cost.
